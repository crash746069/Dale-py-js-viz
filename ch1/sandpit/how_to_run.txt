go to python powershell console:
	python -m http.server 9000
	(python3 -m http.server 9000)

runs a server on port 9000, using index.html


then open up a chrome browser, direct to "http://localhost:9000/"

this should render the index.html file in the current directory


To look under the hood, use Chrome Developer Tools: 
	Console: 	CTRL-SHIFT-J on Windows, CTRL-Option-J on Mac
	Elements tab:	CTRL-SHIFT-C
		You can interactively play with element styling in the Chrome Elements Tab !!!!!!!!!!!!1
			Especially useful when trying to get Scalable Vector Graphics to work !!!!
		Great way to explore the structure of a web page, finding out how the different elements are positioned
		Seeing how the pros apply CSS styles is a good way to learn some useful tricks
	
	Sources tab:
		You can look at any files that contribute to the displayed page (HTML / CSS / JS / etc)
		You can place a breakpoint in code, load page, and see the call stack plus any vars (global or scoped)
		Parametric breakpoints (you can set conditions for them to trigger)
			handy if you want to catch and step thru a particular configuration
		on break, you can step in, out, over functions, etc.
		This Sources tab is fantastic and it is the main reason why Kyran rarely turns to console logging for debugging JS
	Other tools:
		ChromeDevTools keeps updating with new stuff
			memory / profiling / monitor NW downloads / test out different form factors
		But 99% of your time likely in ELements and Sources tabs

	or click in to any of these through "More Tools" > "Developer Tools" >
	CTRL-SHIFT-I opens DevTools to whatever panel you used last
