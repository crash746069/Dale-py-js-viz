Understanding CSS precedence rules is key to successfully applying styles. In a nutshell, the roder is:

    1) !Important
            after CSS property trumps everything
    2)  The more specific the better
            (i.e. ids override classes)
    3)  The order of declaration: last (most recent) declaration wins, subject to conditions (1) and (2)
            I think both within a single CSS file, and within the list of CSS files that are added to your HTML on "link rel" lines
